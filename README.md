## This is a very old application; do not use this to learn Castle Game Engine!

This application was developed using a very old _Castle Game Engine_ version. It still builds with the latest engine version (it is even tested by [GitHub Actions](https://castle-engine.io/github_actions) to make sure we maintain backward-compatibility) but it's absolutely *not* how I would go about implementing this game type now.

*Do not use this game as a learning example.* Instead, get [latest Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io/) and browse `examples` inside the installed engine.

This project is maintained here only:
- for historical purposes
- and as part of automated test to make sure we maintain backward-compatibility when developing new engine versions.

## Introduction

A first 3D game made using "Castle Game Engine" and Blender and VRML models. Done a long time ago (before 2004). Please *do not* use the sources of this game as an example how to use "Castle Game Engine" --- we use here a lot of old, deprecated and uncomfortable ways to deal with 3D stuff!
