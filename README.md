# malfunction

A first 3D game made using "Castle Game Engine" and Blender and VRML models. Done a long time ago (before 2004). Please *do not* use the sources of this game as an example how to use "Castle Game Engine" --- we use here a lot of old, deprecated and uncomfortable ways to deal with 3D stuff!

Complete documentation on http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/malfunction.php .

Using Castle Game Engine, see http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/ .

## Big TODO

**Do not use this code a basis for your projects. It uses really outdated Castle Game Engine API with outdated (deprecated) direct OpenGL fixed-function access.** This is not a way to render on modern GPUs, and this is not a way to use Castle Game Engine :)

This project is only for historical purposes.
